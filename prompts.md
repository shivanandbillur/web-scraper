I fully understand why you are building this project. You need to bypass all the "fluff" on LinkedIn (the marketing agencies, freelancers, B2B vendors who sell marketing services to others) and instead find the actual decision-makers employed internally at brands who are executing Offline/BTL (Below the Line) Marketing for their own brand.

You want internal directors, VPs, managers of offline events, retail merchandising, activations, and brand experiential marketing.

Here are 30 highly targeted prompts you can copy and paste directly into your Web Scraper tool. Because of the code updates we made, the tool will automatically convert these into dynamic, randomized queries that exclude vendors and focus sharply on your ICP.
